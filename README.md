# gingko5

Tool to generate websites from a Gingko App tree

## Install

In order to use Gingko5 you will need to have Perl installed, and some Perl modules that are used in the Gingko5 script. 

### Ubuntu / Debian

```
sudo apt-get install cpanminus
sudo cpanm JSON Text::Markdown Text::PerlPP YAML::Tiny
```

### Other systems

Other systems are likely similar (perhaps replacing 'apt-get' with 'yum'), but we haven't checked them yet. When we do, we will update this file.
